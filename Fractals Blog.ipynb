For those who have concentrated in mathematics during their higher level degrees, we find there are far more geometries than Euclidean. "

Euclid gives five axioms at the beginning of his book 'Elements' from which all theorems or true statements can be derived from. Of course, we must prove the theorems using the axioms provided. This article isn't really about Euclidean geometry so that description should suffice for now."

    "**Fractal Geometry** is a fascinating subject to explore. It is indeed a branch of mathematics but it is also a branch of art.

They were discovered quite by accident as British cartographers were attempting to measure the length of the British coast. The closer they looked, the more detailed and longer the coastline became. They actually discovered one of the main properties of fractals.\n",

Fractals work the same way. No matter how much you zoom in on a fractal, you will see the same shape.\n",

    "**Non-Integer Dimension** can best be explain by using classical geometry. Classical geometry uses objects of integer dimensions. For instance, one dimensional lines and curves, two dimensional plane figures. Think of rectangles and circles. Three dimensional solids like dice and basketballs. Fractals are not so straight forward as classical geometry. They deal with more complex numbers and have interative functions.\n",
